<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>Affects the cubemap which is visible in the water and highly specular asset reflections. Also affects the availability of some environment-specific vanilla assets.</p>




<h2 id="terrain-properties">Terrain Properties</h2>


<h3 id="textures">Textures</h3>

<h4 id="folder">Folder</h4>
<p>The folder where you should put the textures for importing is located here:</p>
<p><span class="path">&#37;LocalAppData&#37;\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\ThemeEditor\ThemeTextures</span></p>
<p>The AppData folder is hidden by default, you can access it by copying and pasting the path into the file explorer, or pressing <span class="key">Windows + R</span> and typing in appdata.</p>

<h4 id="resolution">Resolution</h4>
<p>Map theme textures are usually 1024x1024, 2048x2048 or 4096x4096.</p>

<h4 id="format">Format</h4>
<p>Use a lossless format like .PNG.</p>
<p>The game supports other formats as well, but there is no reason to use another one, it doesn't matter how much your texture is compressed or even if it's completely solid or complicated, the game will convert it to a DXT format, so the final size won't be affected by anything other than resolution.</p>
<p>Make sure the texture is 8 bits/channel because a 16 bits/channel image can't be imported. Do not use the "Smaller File (8-bit)" feature in the Photoshop Export As window, as that creates an indexed color image, not an 8 bits/channel one.</p>

<h4 id="grass">Grass</h4>
<p>The main texture of grass, transparency controls how much the grass texture is affected by the grass color offsets.</p>

<h4 id="ruined">Ruined</h4><div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a0pa1Gz.jpg"><p>

<p>Appears near buildings, some props, networks, and hills which are not steep enough for the cliff texture to be visible. Also visible near pavement surface and can also be painted using surface painter. Also visible under sand, if the opacity of the sand texture is low enough. The opacity is usually very high.</p>

<h4 id="cliff">Cliff</h4><div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0WX4fvb.jpg"><p>

<h4 id="sand">Sand</h4><div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QoQD4lA.jpg"><p>
Example of sand texture.
</p></div>
<p>Can be painted. If the opacity is low, the ruined texture might be visible before the sand becomes fully visible. Can't coexist with the fertile color.</p>

<h4 id="sand-normal">Sand Normal</h4>
<p>Adds bump to the sand texture. <a href='https://cslmodding.info/normal-maps/'>Requires a flipped green channel compared to the normal map standard</a>.</p>

Example of water normal and foam.
</p></div>
<p>The red channel controls the normal foam when the water is moving. The green channel controls the foam on polluted water. It's safe to import a simple black &amp; white foam texture.</p>

<h4 id="building-base-normal">Building Base Normal</h4>
<p>Adds bump to the underground parts of buildings.
