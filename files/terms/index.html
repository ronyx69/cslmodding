<p>Terms of use for <a href='https://cslmodding.info/files'>cslmodding.info/files</a></p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This isn't a legal document or some copy-paste license. This is just me (Ronyx69) explaining how I think this content should be used.
</p>

<h2>Legality</h2>
<p>
Some of my work contains copyrighted content used without permission - e.g. the Honda logo on my Honda Stepwgn model. So I don't consider myself to be entitled to dictate how you are allowed to use this content in your work. You have to decide for yourself.
</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
This content was created for Cities: Skylines, and I expect that it will be mostly used in the same context by others. But if you want to convert these items for other games or create artwork using it, I don't mind at all, as long as it's done fairly according to these terms.
</p>

<h2>Branding & Affiliation</h2>
<p>
If you display my logo or use my "branding", you should not do so in a way that misleads people into thinking that I was personally involved in or approved of your projects.
</p>

<h2>Credit</h2>
<p>
If you use any of my work in a public manner, I expect to be credited and maybe even a link to the source files page or the particular item that you based your work on. If you don't credit me, I will be somewhat disappointed but I won't go hunting you down.
</p>

<h2>Profit</h2>
<p>
If you make small amounts of money (e.g. a 5$ donation a month) from your work which was based on my work, don't worry about it, I don't care. If you make a big amount of money (e.g. 100$ for a commission), then I should receive a cut of the profits proportional to my contribution. If my work has helped you in any way, you can <a href='https://paypal.me/ronyx69'>donate privately</a> or <a href='https://ko-fi.com/ronyx69'>publicly</a>, or buy <a href='https://ronyx69.gumroad.com/l/jpoffice?layout=profile'>the JP office tutorial files</a>, any support is appreciated.
</p>

<h2>Inquiry</h2>
<p>
You don't have to contact me for permission to use any of these files.
</p>

<h2>Intent</h2>
<p>
This was a hobby for me, but I don't mind making money from it. I have built on the work of others, and others can build on the work I've done or learn by looking at the way I've done things, and the players/consumers can get more and better content. I hope that whoever uses these files does the same, for the same reasons.
