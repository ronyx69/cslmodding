<h2 id="mesh">Mesh</h2>



<h3 id="main-mesh">Main Mesh</h3>

<p>This is a 3D model of the prop, which will be visible when the camera is close to it.</p>

<p>It's created using 3D modeling software such as Blender, 3ds Max, Maya or SketchUp.<br>The actual mesh file contains vertices (their coordinates, UV mapping, normals and colors) and triangles.</p>

<h4 id="formats">Formats</h4>
<ul>
<li>FBX (most commonly used)</li>
<li>OBJ (doesn't support vertex colors)</li>
<li>DAE</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="pivot-origin">Pivot / Origin</h4>

<p>The pivot point or origin represents the center point on the ground, where the prop will be plopped. It's usually represented using a red/green/blue axis gizmo.</p>


<h4 id="transform">Transform</h4>

<p>Make sure you are exporting a single object, which doesn't have any rotation or scale.<br />This can be done using <a href='https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/User:Fade/Doc:2.6/Manual/3D_interaction/Transform_Control/Reset_Object_Transformations#Apply_Object_transformations'>&quot;apply rotation &amp; scale&quot; in Blender</a>, or <a href='https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-B98414B9-4F28-45F4-A1F4-9DA994548ED9-htm.html'>&quot;reset xform&quot; in 3ds Max</a>, and exporting only the selected object.</p>


<h4 id="vertex-paint">Vertex Paint</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0a286Ax.jpg"><p>
Vertex painting in 3ds Max.
</p></div>
Vertex colors are used for specific shaders like AnimUV(LINK) for scrolling or multi-frame animations, or PropRotating(LINK) for rotating animations.
</p>


<h4 id="uv-mapping">UV Mapping</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GfAYY35.jpg"><p>
Example UV mapping using visible horizontal tiling on the bottom.
</p></div>
You are allowed to UV map outside the 0-1 area (main tile), so you can tile the entire texture multiple times on a single face.</p>


<h4 id="model-complexity">Model Complexity</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f08NOKr.jpg"><p>
Triangle counts of some vanilla props.
</p></div>

It's recommended to stay within reasonable triangle counts based on the size and detail of your model. You may look at examples of vanilla props or assets by other creators for reference.</p>

<p>The absolute limit for a mesh is 65536 vertices.</p>


<div class="content-info">
<em>
You can use <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=453956891">Mesh Info by SamsamTS</a> to check triangle counts of assets.
</em>
</div>


<h4 id="culling">Culling</h4>

<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nnZCoMq.jpg"><p>
Infinitely thin triangles made by putting 2 of the 3 vertices in the same place.
</p></div>

Prop culling is when a prop disappears when you look away from the center of it.</p>

<p>
If your prop has a low height, or is wide/long, it's recommended to add an invisible triangle which is bigger than your actual mesh to make the game think the prop is larger than it actually is, which will reduce the chance of it disappearing.
</p>




<h3 id="lod-mesh">LOD Mesh</h3>



<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NWAZFvN.jpg"><p>
Comparison between main and LOD meshes for the vanilla grill kiosk.
</p></div>


<p>LOD stands for level of detail. This is the mesh visible from a distance. It must be as simple as possible. Props are usually very small so a model with 1-6 triangles could be enough.</p>

<p>If you don't provide an LOD mesh, the game will try to generate one automatically, which may have visual issues, so it's highly recommended to make a custom LOD mesh.</p>


<h4 id="uv-mapping-1">UV Mapping</h4>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kAR8cmr.jpg"><p>
UV mapping for LOD mesh using automatic mapping in 3ds Max. No overlap and contained within the main tile - good for baking.
</p></div>



<p>
The UV mapping must be within the 0-1 area (main tile) of the UV map, no tiling is allowed. This is because ingame all the LOD textures are combined into a single texture called an atlas, so having incorrect uv mapping will end up putting the texture of some other random prop on your LOD.</p>



<h2 id="textures">Textures</h2>


<h3 id="main-textures">Main Textures</h3>

<p>These determine the color and material properties of your prop.</p>




<h4 id="diffuse">Diffuse (_d)</h4>

<p>
<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YWwTFe5.jpg"><p>
Example diffuse texture for a conveyor prop.
</p></div>

	The main color and texture of your asset.</p>

<p>It will look very bright, contrasty, and saturated in the game, so make sure to reduce the saturation and limit the brightest parts to a medium/light gray below 150 RGB.</p>

<p>If you don't import a diffuse map, it will default to white.</p>




<h4 id="alpha">Alpha (_a)</h4>
<p>


<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EsrQwEb.jpg"><p>
Example alpha texture for some railings and metal beams.
</p></div>
<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/et6nTdO.jpg"><p>
Using lighter values for the invisible parts will decrease the chance of small details like railings disappearing completely.
</p></div>

	Transparency, white means opaque or visible, black means transparent or invisible. Gray values may affect how it looks from a distance or at an angle.</p>

<p>Semi-transparency is not supported, you need to use the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELoMC1rWOSc'>rotors shader</a> for that.</p>

<p>If you don't import an alpha map, it will default to fully opaque or fully visible.</p>



<h4 id="color">Color (_c)</h4>
<p>
	Determines which parts will be affected by color variations. White means fully affected and black means not at all.</p>

<p>The diffuse will get multiplied by the color variation, that means the resulting color will look darker than the original diffuse.</p>

<p>If you don't import a color map, it will default to full color, but the &quot;use color variations&quot; setting must be enabled for the colors to appear.</p>



<h4 id="illumination">Illumination (_i)</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/APmTBu1.jpg"><p>
Example illumination map for a torch.
</p></div>
Allows for diffuse contribution illumination. Black means no illumination and white means the brightest possible illumination. 
</p>
<p><a href='https://cslmodding.info/asset/prop/#m_illuminationblinktype'>There are parameters for blinking illumination or disabling illumination during the day.</a></p>
<p>If you don't import an illumination map, it will default to no illumination.</p>



<h4 id="specular">Specular (_s)</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dpTKCTS.jpg"><p>
Example specular map for a roof water tank.
</p></div>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xZnShPJ.jpg"><p>
Transitions between different specular values produce artifacts on the normal map and vice versa, even if a normal map is not imported.
</p></div>


	Reflectivity, black means no reflection and white means max reflection.</p>

<p>The specular highlight from the sun is very big and bright, so you might want to use very low (0-10%) specularity for surfaces facing upwards.</p>

<p>If you don't import a specular map, it will default to no specularity.</p>




<h4 id="normal">Normal (_n)</h4>
<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tep5ZIS.jpg"><p>
Example normal map for rocks.
</p></div>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CeKq51I.jpg"><p>
Problem: normal maps appear incorrectly if the asset importer mesh rotation feature is used.
</p></div>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BP3Vj1J.jpg"><p>
Problem: default normal map value is 0.5, which isn't possible by using 127(left) or 128(right). Image shows the same flat normal map on faces with different UV rotation/flip.
</p></div>

Also sometimes called a bump map, adds fake depth or form by affecting how the lighting appears.</p>

<p>This can be made from the diffuse or a height map (brighter colors will look extruded out more) using <a href='http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/'>a normal map generator online</a>, a photoshop plugin like <a href='http://www.xnormal.net/'>xNormal</a>, or standalone software such as <a href='https://www.crazybump.com/'>CrazyBump</a>.</p>
<p>The normal map generator should be set to +X +Y, which means no color channel inversions are required.</p>

<p>High specularity and normal map don't work well together because of the compression, so you might want to paint over shiny parts parts with a solid color before generating a normal map, or paint over these parts 128,128,255 on the final normal map.</p>


<p>Read more in the <a href="https://cslmodding.info/normal-maps/">normal map article</a>.</p>


<p>If you don't import a normal map, it will default to a flat normal map - no bump.</p>



<h4 id="format">Format</h4>

<p>Use a lossless format like .PNG.</p>

<p>The game supports other formats as well, but there is no reason to use another one, it doesn't matter how much your texture is compressed or even if it's completely solid or complicated, the game will convert it to a DXT format, so the final size won't be affected by anything other than resolution.</p>

<p>Make sure the texture is 8 bit, because a 16 bit image can't be imported.</p>



<h4 id="resolution">Resolution</h4>
<p>
<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/L4lJ9ki.jpg"><p>
Texture sizes of various vanilla assets. See resolution in top right corner of preview window.
</p></div>

All imported main textures must be the same resolution.
</p>
<p>Powers of 2 is a standard practice in 3D graphics, which means sizes such as 1024x1024, 1024x512, 256x512, 2048x128 etc. It is recommended to stick to this standard, but the most important thing is that your width and height must be divisible by 32, otherwise your texture will be corrupted by compression. You can also use a very small size like 32x16 or 16x16 if necessary.</p>


<div class="content-warning">
<em>
Make sure texture quality is set to high in the game's graphics settings. Otherwise your imported textures will be downscaled to a lower resolution.
</em>
</div>




<h3 id="lod-textures">LOD Textures</h3>

<p>If you don't provide LOD textures, the game will try to bake them using the UV mapping your LOD mesh has, and that may cause visual issues, so it's recommended that you create your own LOD textures using baking.</p>


<h4 id="resolution-1">Resolution</h4>

<p>Powers of 2 is a standard practice in 3D graphics, which means sizes such as 256x256, 256x128, 128x64, 64x64 etc. It is recommended to stick to this standard, but the most important thing is that your width and height must be divisible by 32, otherwise your texture will be corrupted by compression. You can also use a very small size like 32x16 or 16x16 if necessary.</p>















<h2 id="import">Import</h2>



<h3 id="example-asset">Example Asset</h3>

<p>

</a></div>

<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>

<p>The mesh can have any name, but it's not recommended to use spaces or underscores, as the name for the lod mesh name will be meshname_lod.</p>

<p>The textures must have the same name as the mesh, but with the texture type identifier after it, so the result will be names like meshname_d.png and meshname_lod_d.png</p>






<h3 id="import-folder">Import Folder</h3>


<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kcqp2OQ.jpg"><p>
Files ready for import.
</p></div>




<p>You should place the mesh and texture files in the import folder located here:</p>
<p>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Import</p>
<p>The AppData folder is hidden by default, you can access it by pressing <span class="key">Windows + R</span> and typing in appdata.</p>





<h3 id="template">Template</h3>
<p>The template you choose will determine some things about your prop:</p>

<ul>
<li>UI category<br /></li>

<li>item class (UI sub-category)<br /></li>

<li>general settings (create ruining, scale, use color variations)<br /></li>

<li>shader, material properties (color variations)</li>
</ul>



<div class="content-info"><em>
All of those things can be changed later in the editor itself or using <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450877484'>ModTools</a> or other mods.
</em></div>



<h3 id="import-1">Import</h3>

<p>

<div class="content-photo-box"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9jUb6bJ.jpg"><p>
Importing a mesh in asset importer.
</p></div>

After you choose your mesh, depending on how it was exported, you might need to set the correct scale and rotation, scale 100 and rotating 3 times around x axis are common necessities.</p>


<div class="content-warning"><em>
Using the mesh rotation feature will result in broken mesh tangents - that means the normal maps will appear incorrectly or not at all on some parts. To fix this either don't use the rotation and make sure the mesh is rotated properly before import, or if you need to use the mesh rotation feature - use the <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1518485094'>Mesh Import Rotation Tangents Fix mod</a> to fix it.
</em></div>

<div class="content-warning"><em>
If you get an unsupported color error, one of your textures might be a 16 bit file, you need to change it to 8 bit, in Photoshop: Image &gt; Mode &gt; 8 Bits.
</em></div>



<div class="content-warning"><em>
If the mesh preview doesn't display or you can't continue, you may have a problem with it such as multiple mesh objects, other entities like dummies, cameras, lights, or layers in the exported file.
</em></div>










<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>


<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

<p>You can add effects such as lights and particles, and change their position and direction.</p>

<p>The "always active" toggle has no known effect, it's only enabled for the vanilla red/orange roof warning lights, but they still turn off if the building has no electricity or is turned off.</p>



<h3 id="general-properties">General Properties</h3>

<ul>

<li>availability (ingame, map editor etc.)</li>

<li>create ruining (shows map theme ruined texture on the ground)</li>

Prop variations menu in the asset editor.
</p></div>You can add multiple prop assets to your prop as variations using a probability value. The probability is a percentage out of 100, but the main prop has no probability so it gets whatever is left over, so if you have two variations with a 25% probability each, the main prop will get a 50% probability. The variations will be embedded into the main prop, but also show up as seperate props in the menu.</p>

<p>Run <a href='https://gist.github.com/ronyx69/8071d41a135cdb5d1f1f0627b5806b6d'>this script</a> using the <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450877484'>ModTools</a> console <span class=key>F7</span> to set the variation amount, and also calculate equal probability automatically.</p>

<p>To change variables of the asset, open the scene explorer <span class=key>Ctrl+E</span> and go to Tool Controller > ToolController > m_editPrefabInfo. This is where you can find all the fields of the prop, note that some things can only be changed using scripts, and also not all changed fields will save.</p>





<h4 id="m_illuminationblinktype">m_illuminationBlinkType</h4>

<p>Determines the animation of the prop illumination.</p>



<h4 id="m_illuminationoffrange">m_illuminationOffRange</h4>

<p>Determines the upper and lower limit for how long the illumination is disabled during daytime. For lights this usually matches the off range of the light effect which can be found in m_effects > m_effects.[id] > m_effect > m_offRange. You can also use <a href='https://gist.github.com/ronyx69/bfa8940c8d68f99b8826c88af51a39b7'>this script</a> to change it using an hour value.</p>

<ol>
<li>On the snapshot image, bottom right corner.



<p>Use this one to replace the snapshot, you can replace it with a 1x1 px image to save on the asset file size. This image will only be visible in the content manager. It will also default as the Steam preview image, but you can change that seperately when publishing.</p></li>


<li>Below thumbnail, on the right side.



<p>Use this one to change the thumbnail (109x100) and tooltip (492x147) of your asset.<br /> Once you change the main thumbnail, the hover/active states will update automatically.</p></li>

The largest size the image will be visible is 437x437 (on the front page) but it will get upscaled to 512x512 by Steam so that's the size you should use.</p>

<p>There is also the content folder, which is where the actual asset file is. You can paste multiple .crp files here if you would like to upload a pack of assets.</p>



<h3 id="steam-workshop">Steam Workshop</h3>

<p>On the Steam Workshop page for your asset, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>add it to a collection<br /></li>

<li>add images and videos<br /></li>

<li>add contributors and links<br /></li>

<li>add required items and DLC<br /></li>

<li>change visibility to friends only or private</li>

</ul>
















<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>To update your own item, you must subscribe to it first, then it will show up in the content manager. It won't be the same as a local asset, as it will show an &quot;update&quot; button.</p>

<p>When you click update, click the folder icon, and now you can change the Steam preview image and put your new asset in the content folder. If updating a pack, remember to put all the assets inside the content folder.</p>

<p>You can also add more assets to make it a bigger pack.</p>


<div class="content-warning"><em>
Make sure your updated assets are saved with exactly the same name as before, otherwise it will disappear from your subscribers' saves, as the game uses the internal prefab name to refer to it. In the case of networks (roads, tracks etc.) it may completely break a save.
